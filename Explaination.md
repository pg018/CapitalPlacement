### Commit Number 3 => First Task Done, Second Task In Progress...

In the first task, I set up the directory structure which included controllers, core level, infrastructure as top level
directories...
Within the controllers are all the controllers....
Within the core level are the services, enums, custom validators and models...
Within the infrastructure is the files for cosmos document structure...

The architecture I have followed is CLEAN architecture...

For each incoming request, there is a dto (Data Transfer Objects) which brings the data to controller..
The data undergoes validation processess for each api and then the required operation is performed...
